# Roadmap

I like art. Art is pretty. I want people to look at art. I want to get more confortable with APIs and React/Next. Use components an appropriate amount to prevent confusion and show off my skills as a developer. I want multiple routes.

## Explore Art

  - [x] Do a test call to make sure I understand the API
- [x] Pick API I like
- [ ] Make pretty

## Nav Bar

- [x] Search option
- [x] Different Categories
- [x] Link to my code and resume
- [ ] Info about API

## Search Results Page

- [x] As a user I want to be able to type a keyword into a search bar and see any art related to that keyword
  - [x] Thumbnails in a list with Art title and artist name
  - [x] Each thumbail to be clickable
  - [ ] Make pretty

## Details Page

- [x] Once clicked, user will be directed to a new page with larger image and more details about art
- [ ] As a user viewing that art details page I want to see a 
  - [ ] description of the artwork as well as 
  - [x] year
