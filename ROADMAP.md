# Roadmap

I like art. Art is pretty. I want people to look at art. I want to get more confortable with APIs and React/Next. Use components an appropriate amount to prevent confusion and show off my skills as a developer. I want multiple routes.

## Explore Art

- [ ] Call API successfully
  - [ ] Do a test call to make sure I understand the API
- [ ] Pick API I like
## Nav Bar
- [ ] Search option
- [ ] Different Categories
- [ ] Link to my code and resume
- [ ] Info about API
## Search Results Page
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to type a keyword into a search bar and see any art related to that keyword
  - [ ] Thumbnails in a list with Art title and artist name
  - [ ] Each thumbail to be clickable
## Details Page
  - [ ] Once clicked, user will be directed to a new page with larger image and more details about art
  - [ ] As a user viewing that art details page I want to see a description of the artwork as well as year, title and artist name
